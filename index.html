Free Spirit: the music of Margaret Lucy Wilkins
VVM 3055
CD Reviews

It is a very beautiful production.

I like her music very much with its plasticity and precise craftmanship.
Siegrid Ernst, June 2003

..... this ‘portrait CD’ is no push-over. The content is music with vitality, promoted by fine performers who
link their understanding and skills to the output of composers who write for to-day and to-morrow.
Margaret Lucy Wilkins deserves this exposure, as much for the 1989 Symphony as the rest. ......its
qualities show her invention and the skills that harness it.
<br></br>
Basil Ramsay, Music & Vision, April 2003

A composer who has things to say, and who says them in the best possible way, in vivid, arresting and
often gripping terms.
Demanding, but very rewarding music.
<br></br>
Hubert Culot,www.musicweb.uk.net, October 2003
   

There is no denying Wilkins’ imagination for textures, and she has the commitment and ability to see her
ideas through – a real composer, there’s no doubt about it, and one with a distinctive voice and personality.
......it has to be said straight away that this is a highly impressive issue. The standard of both performance
and recording is very high, and there are notable contributions from Barrie Webb, who is the brilliant
trombonist in 366" as well as the conductor of two items, and from soprano Alison Wells.
I am looking forward to hearing it again – it undoubtedly stays in the memory. This is a tribute in itself, when
so much contemporary music, full of empty gestures and technical ‘wizardry’ is instantly forgettable.
It would be wonderful if more British universities had senior music staff writing such intelligent, individual
music. My congratulations to everybody who worked on the major project that this recording represents.
Gwyn Parry-Jones, http://www.musicweb.uk.net October 2003

...her idiom is apparently conservative in its tonal focus, yet it’s tough and gritty.
The string trio, Burnt Sienna, gets a taut, electric performance from The Firebird Trio.
This music shows nobility of spirit – not an over-used commodity in much authentically
contemporary composition – and great integrity and originality.
    <br></br>
Andy Hamilton/ The Wire/ February 2004

I am the author of the book Music Inspired by Art: A Guide to
Recordings, Scarecrow Press. I was excited when I learned
today that the new VMM 3055, "Free Spirit," includes Margaret
Lucy Wilkins' "Musica Angelorum" which was inspired by
medieval paintings of angels. This will be another significant
addition to my new edition.
    <br></br>
Gary Evans, June 2003

Burnt Sienna: Etude for String Trio is a beautiful essay in string writing; and, to my mind, the
most readily approachable work in this cross-section of Wilkins’ output. 366" for solo trombone
is a free fantasy including some discrete music-theatre techniques (the player is heard tapping
his feet on the floor) but, on the whole, I found it a more engaging work than Berio’s Sequenza
V.
Musica Angelorum for string orchestra is another study in string writing and, in every respect, as
successful and attractive as Burnt Sienna. Many arresting moments in this atmospheric piece
that vastly repays repeated hearings.
Wilkins’ large-scale symphony is by far the most substantial work here. It was composed in
1989 but was first performed ten years later by the same performers as on this disc. (The
recording was actually made a few months after the premiere.) It is in three movements
(Exposition, Juxtaposition, Oppositions) in the fairly traditional fast-slow-fast pattern, although
this is as far as tradition goes. The whole work is in fact rather unusual in its conception, for
most of it is a far cry from any such traditional symphonic scheme. The first movement is rather
a kaleidoscope of "sculptured textures" (the composer’s words) that are repeated a number of
times, though the repetitions are interrupted by unrelated material. The second movement is a
beautiful slow arch form whose argument is mainly carried by the strings (Wilkins has a real
feeling for and liking of string textures). The third movement is again a fast one, and quite similar
to the opening one, which it actually mirrors. This energetic movement is abruptly cut short,
leaving many ‘unanswered questions’. With its brass heavy scoring and its block structures,
Wilkins’ Symphony is a powerful, granite-like statement of some considerable strength. No easy
stuff ... tough.
Composer’s portraits, such as the present release, are the ideal way to get to know the music of
composers who are new to you. The present release is no exception in this respect. Wilkins is
obviously a composer who has things to say, and who says them in the best possible way, in
vivid, arresting and often gripping terms. Her music is particularly well served by all the present
players who put all their heart and conviction into this often quite demanding, but very rewarding
music. Really well worth investigating.

solo oboe andpercussion, most of the live music comes from a large number of brass players, indifferent locations, and the score
provides for a rich texture of resonant sound,rising, falling and echoing in its important contribution to the atmosphere of

frequently a theatrical element in Margaret Lucy Wilkins’ works, though never overdone, and a thoughtful exploitation of spatial
elements. Musicians often play offstage, or move around during a performance.This aspect came to the fore in a piece written
specially for this concert. Rituelle for 24 wind players and 3 percussionists in six perambulating groups is a fascinating, charming
and very effective piece. It deserves to be heard again --- soon! ‘ David Briers, Huddersfield Examiner.

CD Reviews
<br></br>
It is a very beautiful production.
<br></br>
I like her music very much with its plasticity and precise craftmanship.
    <br></br>
Siegrid Ernst, June 2003

….. this ‘portrait CD’ is no push-over. The content is music with vitality, promoted by fine performers who link
their understanding and skills to the output of composers who write for to-day and to-morrow.Margaret Lucy
Wilkins deserves this exposure, as much for the 1989 Symphony as the rest. ……its qualities show her
invention and the skills that harness it.
<br></br>
Basil Ramsay, Music &amp; Vision, April 2003

A composer who has things to say, and who says them in the best possible way, in vivid, arresting and often
gripping terms.Demanding, but very rewarding music.

Hubert Culot,www.musicweb.uk.net, October 2003

There is no denying Wilkins’ imagination for textures, and she has the commitment and ability to see her ideas
through – a real composer, there’s no doubt about it, and one with a distinctive voice and personality.……it has
to be said straight away that this is a highly impressive issue. The standard of both performance and recording is
very high, and there are notable contributions from Barrie Webb, who is the brilliant trombonist in 366&quot; as well
as the conductor of two items, and from soprano Alison Wells. I am looking forward to hearing it again – it
undoubtedly stays in the memory. This is a tribute in itself, when so much contemporary music, full of empty
gestures and technical ‘wizardry’ is instantly forgettable. It would be wonderful if more British universities had
senior music staff writing such intelligent, individual music. My congratulations to everybody who worked on
the major project that this recording represents.

…her idiom is apparently conservative in its tonal focus, yet it’s tough and gritty. The string trio, Burnt
Sienna, gets a taut, electric performance from The Firebird Trio. This music shows nobility of spirit – not an over-
used commodity in much authentically contemporary composition – and great integrity and originality.

I am the author of the book Music Inspired by Art: A Guide to
Recordings, Scarecrow Press.  I was excited when I learned today
that the new VMM 3055, &quot;Free Spirit,&quot; includes Margaret Lucy
Wilkins&#39; &quot;Musica Angelorum&quot; which was inspired by medieval
paintings of angels.  This will be another significant addition to my
new edition.

Gary Evans, June 2003

Burnt Sienna: Etude for String Trio is a beautiful essay in string writing; and, to my
mind, the most readily approachable work in this cross-section of Wilkins’ output. 366&quot;
for solo trombone is a free fantasy including some discrete music-theatre techniques (the
player is heard tapping his feet on the floor) but, on the whole, I found it a more engaging
work than Berio’s Sequenza V.Musica Angelorum for string orchestra is another study in
string writing and, in every respect, as successful and attractive as Burnt Sienna. Many
arresting moments in this atmospheric piece that vastly repays repeated hearings.Wilkins’
large-scale symphony is by far the most substantial work here. It was composed in 1989
but was first performed ten years later by the same performers as on this disc. (The
recording was actually made a few months after the premiere.) It is in three movements
(Exposition, Juxtaposition, Oppositions) in the fairly traditional fast-slow-fast pattern,
although this is as far as tradition goes. The whole work is in fact rather unusual in its
conception, for most of it is a far cry from any such traditional symphonic scheme. The
first movement is rather a kaleidoscope of &quot;sculptured textures&quot; (the composer’s words)
that are repeated a number of times, though the repetitions are interrupted by unrelated
material. The second movement is a beautiful slow arch form whose argument is mainly
carried by the strings (Wilkins has a real feeling for and liking of string textures). The
third movement is again a fast one, and quite similar to the opening one, which it actually
mirrors. This energetic movement is abruptly cut short, leaving many ‘unanswered
questions’. With its brass heavy scoring and its block structures, Wilkins’ Symphony is a
powerful, granite-like statement of some considerable strength. No easy stuff …
tough.Composer’s portraits, such as the present release, are the ideal way to get to know
the music of composers who are new to you. The present release is no exception in this
respect. Wilkins is obviously a composer who has things to say, and who says them in the
best possible way, in vivid, arresting and often gripping terms. Her music is particularly
well served by all the present players who put all their heart and conviction into this often
quite demanding, but very rewarding music. Really well worth investigating.-- Hubert
